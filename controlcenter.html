        <div class="brodtext2"><p>The problem we faced with iOS today is that it’s bad at multitasking. Double click the home button is bad for your thumbs and having 12+ apps open at the same time doesn’t make it easier finding what you are looking for.
We do know that the fastest action on an iOS device is the control centre which you can reach from everywhere and it’s located close to your thumb.
We thought we would optimize it a bit.</p>
            
            
             <div class="pfs">
        <img src="images/process_design.png" alt="Inget Filter">
        </div>
            
            
            <p>During this project we worked in teams of three. We began to write a list of apps and then we went through them just to see if we had any problems. In some apps, we saw a few problems but then we came to the conclusion that it all went back to phone. How do we easily and effortless switch between apps? We all know you can double tap the home button but it’s not that convenient when you are looking for that special app. </p>
            
          
            <p> So this is our vision for the new iOS Control Centre optimized for multitasking. See video down below and check out the article that we wrote for <a href="https://medium.com/@michellewelin/the-new-ios-control-centre-41e286392919">Medium</a> here.  </p>
