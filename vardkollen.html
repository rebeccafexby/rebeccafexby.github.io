        <div class="brodtext2"><p><b>AppInMed</b> is a company that creates applications within the medical care system for clinics and patients. AppInMed wants to digitalize medical care from the patient’s perspective. AppInMed came to us for an idea and concept that will create a tighter bond between patients and medical care system. </p>

 <div class="brodtext2"> <p>  <b>The concept</b>
Our finalised concept is to give the patient control over their own healthcare information through an app platform. The app has a core function which is a timeline, this will give the patient a complete overview of their medical history. The timeline is connected with the patient’s journal and the patient can choose to share this information to new doctors and clinics. Other features in the app is a profile with name, blood type, “frikort” and other short useful information, booking appointments in two ways; drop in at any nearby clinic or getting a time slot at the patient’s registered health clinic, prescription which give the patient the opportunity to see what’s been prescribed and what prescription the patient have had.  The last feature is a chat with the doctor, this chat are accessible for the patient after an approval from the doctor. </p>
<p>
All the features are synced with the timeline where the patient can filter the information that will show. The app platform will give the patient more control and we believe that control will cure frustration and create a tighter bond between patients and medical care system.
