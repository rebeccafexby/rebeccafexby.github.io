<p>We got a brief in school for our development module. We were working in groups of 5-6 people. The brief was to create a platform that would either help the refruge crisis or help to spread awareness that nationalism and rasism is spreading through Europe. So we did a platform showing that multiculturalism and intergration is good. We actually got the votes of the class to go and present our project at an after work at Wrapp's office.

<p><b>My role</b> during this project was doing mostly research about the different subjects and what had been done before. I also did my own portfolio on the side.

<p>Ignorance is spreading. Wrong facts are spreading. Misleading information becomes people's truth. Hatred, ignorance and racism explodes - we are all a part of it. Why do we only look away? It is time to open our eyes to the real facts, that our society is enriched by other cultures and thrives on multiculturalism. 

<p>We have created a platform with information in an easy and humorous way to increase the user's understanding and provide more insight into how our modern society favored by multiculturalism. The goal is to increase knowledge, reduce prejudices and crush nationalism and therefore create a better society for all.</p>
We believe in addressing xenophobia with knowledge, crush hatred with love and transform fear into solidarity.
